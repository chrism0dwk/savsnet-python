SAVSNet Python functions
========================

This folder contains the savsnet Python module, containing Python functions to analyse SAVSNet data.  The functions are generic, and other users may find them useful.


GP Smoothing of case timeseries
-------------------------------

The `savsnet/prev_ts_GP` module contains functions that build a Binomial regression model with a Gaussian process linear predictor to model a timeseries of Binomial random variables (e.g. prevalence).  See docstrings for each function for further details.  For convenience, the module may be run as a script, for example:
````bash
$ python savsnet/prev_ts_GP.py -c trauma -s dog cat -i 1000 -o pred myData.csv
````
where myData.csv is a CSV file containing (minimally) a 'Date' column (ISO format), 'Consult_reason', and 'Species' columns.

See 
````bash
$ python savsnet/prev_ts_GP.py --help
````
for further details.


Plotting of GP smooths
----------------------

The `savsnet/plot_ts_GP` module contains functions for plotting posterior predictive distributions from savsnet/prev_ts_GP output.  Documentation for individuals functions are contained in the docstrings.  For convenience, the module may be run as a script, for example:
````bash
$ python savsnet/plot_ts_GP.py -d myData.csv -s dog cat -c trauma -p pred_dog_trauma.pkl pred_cat_trauma.pkl -o gpFigure.pdf
````

See
````bash
$ python savsnet/plot_ts_GP.py --help 
````
for further details.


Spatial mapping of cases
------------------------

The `savsnet/logistic2D` module contains functions for spatial smoothing of case occurrence at point locations, using an inducing point approximation to a logistic geostatistical model with stationary mean and Mat√©rn ($k=3/2$) covariance function.  This is called by the `logisticKrige.py` Python script such as:
```bash
$ python logistic_krige.py -i 5000 -s '2020-03-04' -p gadm36_GBR.gpkg myData.csv
```
where `myData.csv` is a CSV file containing at least the headings `consult_date` (ISO date format), `person_easting` and `person_northing` (in rectangular coordinates), and `case` (1 or 0 denoting positive or negative for a given condition).  The script runs the logistic geostatistic model, writes the posterior to a Python pickle file and the posterior mean to a GeoTIFF file.

See
```bash
$ python logisticKrige.py --help
```
for information on further arguments.
